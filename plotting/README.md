The contents of this folder are small plotting scripts to illustrate the results of the experiments. You may need to create folders if they do not exist.

> The files in this folder are not linted, and are intended to be modified depending on your needs.

Files:
- `all_graphs.py`: Plots the train, dev, test partition of the metrics introduced.
- `colors.py`: Small script to create a pie chart of colors, useful for choosing the colors.
- `double_graph.py`: Plots the dev and test partition of the metrics introduced (in different graphs).
- `get_speed_graph.py`: Gets a graph of the speed and performance of the models.
- `get_table.py`: Gets a table of the speed of each technique to get to its best performance.
- `gmacs.py`: Plots the usage of MACs for each technique and dataset.
- `one_graph.py`: Plots a single partition of the metrics introduced (in different graphs).
- `vram.py`: Plots the usage of VRAM for each technique and dataset.
